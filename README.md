# RBFNeuralNetwork
simple radial basis function (RBF) and  also elliptic basis function (EBF) neural network implementation with tensorflow (version 1.0)

### this implementation baced on tensorflow. 
- for filndig Mu (center of each cluster for RBF centers) we use sklearn.kMeans (for now)
- we use RLS (Recursive Least Square) method for learning models.
