# RBFNeuralNetwork
simple radial basis function (RBF) and  also elliptic basis function (EBF) neural network implementation with tensorflow (version 1.0)
<br />
for using this class you need tensorflow as basic material, sklearn.kmeans ( for now,in the future we add our implemented kmeans) and also numpy
<br />
simpleClassification and simpleRegression python files written for sample usage of RBFNN class
<br />
-- special thanks to @Milad_Bohluli for Helping me in implementtation this class
